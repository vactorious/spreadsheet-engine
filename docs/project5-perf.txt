Theory -    In rename_sheet, we were calling a visitor every time,
            regardless of whether or not there were cell references. By
            checking if there are any cells with cell references in the sheet
            to be renamed, we can eliminate unnecessary calls to the visitor
            which should significantly improve speeds.

Rationale - Our rename_sheet implementation was 109.1x slower than the
            RenameSheetNoCellrefUpdateBenchmark from project 4.

Outcome -   We tried making changes to improve renaming performance, but
            unforuntately our attempts did not result better performance.


Theory -    We were calling quantify_cell_loc() on the bottom right cell in the
            specified range just for the purpose of checking if the bottom 
            right cell is beyond the max cell location limit ZZZZ9999.
            This has a 

Rationale - Our move and copy sheet implementations were about 7x slower than
            the benchmarks from project 4.

Outcome -   We attempted to implement checking without calling
            quantify_cell_loc() but were unable to get it working.
